qidtrace  version 0.10
===============================

qidtrace is a filter for sendmail log files.
It follows sendmails queue id strings so that sequences of log
lines can be found.

The program reads the input sendmail log file in one pass.

The input data file is maillog.mx.
The initial release provides an abbreviated 9999-line input file.

Execute the tests using prove (specify the local lib if the module
is not installed in the @INC path):
  prove -I lib -vr t

The initial version comprises a framework, and the core methods
are not included.  They are to be written as an exercise for the
student.



Version 0.10, Sun2011_0821_10:21 

This version operates properly and might find all matching
lines; but it performs poorly.
It handles the 9999-line file in a short time, but does not 
process the larger file with more than 4M lines.

Use this version to compare its o/p w/ a future version 
using a different approach to find matching lines.  Verify
that any future version finds all the matched lines that
this version finds.
