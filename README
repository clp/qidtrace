qidtrace  version 0.32
===============================

qidtrace is a filter for sendmail log files.
It follows sendmails queue id strings so that sequences of log
lines can be found.

The program reads the input sendmail log file in one pass.

The input data file is maillog.mx.
The initial release provides an abbreviated 9999-line input file.

Execute the tests using prove (specify the local lib if the module
is not installed in the @INC path):
  prove -I lib -vr t

The initial version comprises a framework, and the core methods
are not included.  They are to be written as an exercise for the
student.



Version 0.10, Sun2011_0821_10:21 

This version operates properly and might find all matching
lines; but it performs poorly.
It handles the 9999-line file in a short time, but does not 
process the larger file with more than 4M lines.

Use this version to compare its o/p w/ a future version 
using a different approach to find matching lines.  Verify
that any future version finds all the matched lines that
this version finds.


Version 0.20, Thu2011_0915

This version operates properly but does not find all matching
lines (mostly fixed in later updates of this version by
changing code in drain_queue()).  It performs very well, by
checking only lines in the buffer for matching qid's, instead
of checking all saved qid's for a match.  It handles the
4M-line input file in less than 2 minutes.

It prints o/p data groups when found, not at end of program.


Version 0.30, Tue2011_0920

Operates quickly & finds matches, but might add some duplicate
lines on o/p.

It prints o/p data groups only at end of program.


Version 0.31, Tue2011_0920

Store a hash reference when a match is found.  This structure
includes the matching line, its email address and qid, and its
line number.  Part of the program uses this new structure.


Version 0.32, Tue2011_0920

Update drain_queue() to use the data structure added in v 0.31.
