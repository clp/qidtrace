=head2 Print All Matching Lines

Use two loops to print the collection of o/p lines, grouped 
and sorted by qid.

The outer loop dereferences the hash ref,
  selects the keys (which are qid's),
  sorts the list by qid,
  then iterates over its block using each qid as the index value.

The inner loop takes the qid as a key for the %_seen hash,
  gets the hash value for that key (which is a ref to an array),
  dereferences the array,
  iterates over every member of that array,
  and prints each line found in that array.

usage $prog: [options] -m match_string <log_files>

$prog is a filter for sendmail log files.
It follows sendmails queue id strings so that sequences of log lines can be found.

Options to control the matching

-match-pattern string    log lines are matched against this literal (not regex) pattern.
                         typical usage is an email address, or a virus name.
                         Required.

-window-size   int       a window of log lines both in front of, and behind the current line
                         is kept.  Matches will be found in this buffer.
                         Default: 100

Output options

-number-output  flag     emit the line number of the matching line on output

-start-column   int      Control what portion of the matching line is displayed.
                         start-column gives the first column of the output line displayed.
-output-length  int      Length of the output line before line numbering, if any.
