qidtrace

A project to learn some techniques of Perl coding, based on
searching a log file for specific data.

My first solution to this problem is described in another
project - see this repository at github:
  https://github.com/clp/sendmail_trace

The original files for qidtrace were built by Jeff M., and
provided on 2011_0727

My task is to write the missing code inside this framework.

I committed the code files to the repository before making any
changes to them.
Then I made a branch called clp.master, and began my work 
on the code in that branch.
Use 'git diff' to see my work on this project, eg,
  git diff master clp.master
